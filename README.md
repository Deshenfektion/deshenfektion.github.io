# Welcome to my Portfolio!

Hi, in this portfolio, I would like to showcase selected projects!

## 🧩 About Me

People call me Desh and I'm interested in building custom applications because I am tired of spending countless hours trying to find the "perfect app", when I can just make them myself – all while making life just a little more exciting! 👾

## 📂 Projects

### [<img src="./assets/mariotodo-favicon.png" width="16" height="16"> MarioTodo](https://github.com/Deshenfektion/MarioTodo)

A playful todo app styled like a Super Mario game. Combines a fun UI with a sense of progress and reward to boost motivation.

### [<img src="./assets/heatmap-favicon.png" width="16" height="16"> MyHeatmap](https://github.com/Deshenfektion/MyHeatmap)

A minimalist heatmap app inspired by GitHub's commit grid. Lets users define custom rows and track habits or routines through click-based activity squares.

## 🚀 Goals

- Building strong fundamentals and not relying too much on abstractions (e.g. always the same frameworks)
- Embracing passion for development, constantly learning more about it and having fun!
