# Hi I'm Desh

## 🧩 About Me

I'm interested in building custom applications because I am tired of spending countless hours trying to find the "perfect app", when I can just make them myself – all while making life just a little more exciting! 👾

## 🚀 Goals

- Building strong fundamentals and not relying too much on abstractions (e.g. always the same frameworks)
