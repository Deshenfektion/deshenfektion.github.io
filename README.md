# Welcome to my Portfolio!

In this portfolio, I would like to showcase selected projects!

## ðŸ§© About Me

My friends call me Desh and I'm interested in building custom applications because I am tired of spending countless hours trying to find the "perfect app", when I can just make them myself â€“ all while making life just a little more exciting. ðŸ‘¾

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Building useful software while being creative
- Building strong fundamentals and not relying too much on abstractions (e.g. always the same languages or frameworks)
- Embracing passion for development, constantly learning more about it and having fun!
